A Simple Calculator App written in Java

Hey we all start somewhere, and I am no exception. Although i'm integrating with REST APIs professionally, and building Spring Boot Web APIs in my spare time we all have to build those classic projects. This is my first ever Java project, and I wanted to make it public. The purpose of the project was to learn how to handle exceptions, and i had to create my own to handle dividing by 0 with a double.

it is a horrible design where all the logic and swing GUI are contained in the main method (GASP! I'll pause a minute while you get sick). Please revel in my past mistakes that i have since learned from!
